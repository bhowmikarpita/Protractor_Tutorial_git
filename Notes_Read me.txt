What is Protractor
What is Angular and AngularJS
What is WebdriverJS

Protractor is an end-to-end test framework for Angular and AngularJS applications
Protractor is a Node.js program built on top of WebDriverJS
Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would
Protractor can also be used to test non-angular applications

What is AngularJS
AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework mainly maintained by Google
Type - Open-source web application framework
Written in - JavaScript
Developed by - Google
Initial release - Oct 2010

Also referred to as Angular 1

What is Angular
Angular is a platform and framework for building client applications in HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in TypeScript
Type - Open-source web application framework
Written in - TypeScript
Developed by - Google
Initial release - Sep 2016

Also referred to as Angular 2+ or Angular v2 and above

Why there is no ver 3 of Angular 
The angular router was on version 3.x before Angular 3 would have been released. 
The new ver. when released would have gone with router ver 4.x

In an effort to prevent confusion they skipped Angular 3 and scheduled Angular 4 to coincide with Angular router 4

What is Node.js
platform to develop server-side networking applications
is open source
is cross-platform

Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.

What is WebDriverJS
Protractor is built on top of WebDriverJS

WebDriverJs is the Official javascript implementation of selenium
WebDriverJs helps to interact with elements on the web
Protractor extends WebDriverJS functionalities to enable automation of user actions on browser applications

1. Selenium webdriver does not have methods/features to locate elements based on Angular specific properties/locators

Protractor is a wrapper over Selenium webdriverjs and provides support to find angular specific elements

2. Synchronization issues while automating Angular (JS) applications with Selenium webdriver

3. A lot of web applications these days are created with Angular and AngularJS

Synchronous programming
In a synchronous programming model, things happen one at a time. 
Each operation has to wait for the previous one to be completed, before it can be executed.
Asynchronous programming
An asynchronous model allows multiple things to happen at the same time. Operations can be executed WHILE the query is being processed.
1.Test scripts send commands to the Selenium Server
2.Selenium Server interacts with Browser Drivers
3.Browser Drivers interact with application on the real browser

On execution, test commands goes to selenium server.
Server interprets these commands
After interpretation, server sends commands to browser drivers
Communication between server and browser happen through JSON Wire protocol
Commands are interpreted by browser drivers and executed on the application running on real browsers

Before performing any action on the browser, Protractor runs extra commands to ensure the application has stabilized
This will result in 3 commands being sent to browser driver
/session/:sessionId/execute_async 
/session/:sessionId/element
/session/:sessionId/element/:id/click 
Step 1 : Download and install node.js
 https://nodejs.org/en/download/
 node -v
 npm -v

Step 2 : Install Protractor
 npm install -g protractor
 protractor --version

Step 3 : Run command
 webdriver-manager update

Step 4 : Find conf.js file at C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\protractor\example

On cmd goto the location of this file
and run command
protractor conf.js
Webstorm
Eclipse
Visual Studio Code

Step 1 : Download and install Visual Studio Code
 https://code.visualstudio.com/download#

Step 2 : Open VS Code

Step 3 : Install support for JavaScript and TypeScript

Step 4 : Create a new folder and open in VS Code explorer

Step 5 : Inside ProtractorDemo folder create 2 folders
 conf
 tests

note : protractor uses jasmine test framework by default
Just in case you need to install jasmine use the command
npm install --save-dev jasmine

Step 6 : Goto the folder 
  C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\protractor\example

Copy conf.js into conf folder in VSCode
Copy example_spec.js into tests folder in VSCode

Step 7 : In conf.js update location of spec file

Step 8 : Run conf.js in protractor
 protractor conf.js

1. How to create a test file
2. How to add steps in test file
3. How to add element locators
4. How to run test
conf.js - configurations like browser, framework, etc
spec.js - tests are present in spec file
